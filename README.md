# TFM_GERMAN_VALLEJO

 This is the code I developed for my bioinfirmatics Master final project.
 
TCGA CLUSTERS ANALYSIS:
This section includes the results of the RNA-Seq data analysis and survival analysis for a cohort of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. The analysis is subdivided into 5 notebooks:

--> Clustering: Unsupervised Gaussian classification of patients based on their gene expression.

--> Kaplan-Meier_TCGA_clusters: Survival analysis of the clusters.

--> Differential_expression_and_Functional_analysis: Differential expression and functional analysis between the clusters.

--> TumorDecon: Deconvolution of immune cells and comparison of immune infiltration in both clusters.

--> WGCNA: Analysis of co-expressed gene networks.

sc_RNA_Seq:
Re-analysis of a sc-RNA-Seq dataset obtained from Peng et al. (Cell Research, 2019, 29:725â€“738; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-019-0195-y). The data is not available due to its large size, but the code includes links to the repositories where it was obtained. It is divided into 5 notebooks:

--> Single_Cell_RNA_Seq_analysis: Preprocessing, normalization, integration, and annotation of the sc-RNA-Seq experiment.

--> Differential_expression_analysis: Analysis of differential and functional expression of ductal cells vs. malignant ductal cells and endothelial cells from tumor tissue vs. control.

--> TF_Pathways_activities: Analysis of biological pathway activity and transcription factor activity in ductal cells and malignant ductal cells using decoupleR.

--> Complementary_analysis: Generation of plots of interest.

--> Risk_signature_analysis: Analysis of genes of interest from the risk signature.

RNA-Seq:
Analysis of the transcriptomic effects (RNA-Seq) of BPTF gene silencing in conjunction with TNFa treatment in PDAC model cell lines, with samples generated in our laboratory. It contains a notebook within the RNA-Seq pre-analysis folder with the bash commands used in the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline. It also contains another notebook (RNA_Seq_Analysis) with downstream analysis.

Risk_signature:
Obtaining a risk signature of BPTF-dependent genes. It contains two notebooks:

--> Risk_signature: Obtaining and validating the risk signature.

--> Risk_signature_genes_analysis: Analysis of the prognostic value of each gene in the signature individually.
